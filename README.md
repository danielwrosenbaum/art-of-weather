# art-of-weather

A weather app that allows the user to look up the current weather in a city while viewing an historic painting that has a similar vibe and setting.

[Weather as Art](https://danielwrosenbaum.github.io/ajax-project/)

## Features:

1. User can view the current weather conditions of any city in the world simply by typing in the city's name.
2. User will also be able to view a painting from the Rijksmuseum collection that matches the requested city's weather conditions.
3. User will be able to save the images generated from Rijksmuseum to local storage.
4. User will be given the option to either get new weather conditions or view saved images on the app's homescreen.
5. User will be able to delete any image from the saved collection.

## Planned Additions

* User can see live radar map of current weather in city.
* Animate weather icons that generate along with weather conditions.
* User can send themselves links to the images via email.

## Things I Learned

* Ability to grab data from multiple API's and use data from one API to generate content from another.
* How to probably save and delete from localstorage at the same time as you save and delete from webpage.
* How to adjust media settings for mobile and screen without limiting functionality for either.
* How to add a loading spinner that appears whenever an API request is loading.
